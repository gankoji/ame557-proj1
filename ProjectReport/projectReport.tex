  \begin{abstract}
    This is the abstract of the report. Here we'll sound super snobby
    and kill it to impress Rosengren.
  \end{abstract}

  \section {Introduction} This is the beginning of the introduction of
    the report. This is a section.
    \subsection {This is a subsection}
    
    \paragraph{}We can separate the sections into subsections. We can
    also add paragraphs, as below.
    
    ¶ Here's the paragraph, within the subsection. These markings
    should be the way we separate out all our different paragraphs and
    sections.

    ¶ Obviously, you shouldn't directly edit the pdf file, as that is
    generated by LaTeX. Instead, edit the source file in this
    directory (projectReport.tex). 


    \section{Theory of Orbit Determination}
    At this point, the pattern should be pretty obvious. This is where
    I'll leave things for now.
