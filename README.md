A location for us to push our research, code, and report for Rosengren's first project. 

# Getting Started
I'm assuming you both know how to use GitHub. If you don't, there's
quite a few resources available to you on google, so I won't waste
your time here. It will probably be easiest for your workflow if you
take at least a smidge of time to get familiar with git concepts like
staging, committing, branching, and push/pull from remote hosts. 

I would prefer if we all had our own branch(es), and waited to merge
those into master until we all agreed the changes were good. 

I understand if this seems like a little bit too much process for such
a small effort, but I'm hoping that if we take the few minutes to get
setup here it will make our lives much easier down the line. -JB 09/26
